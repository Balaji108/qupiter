Qupiter : World's largest natural quantum Computer- planet Jupiter.
What If Planet Jupiter is a naturally formed quantum computer?

@Archestration: Scientist found Jupiter with its enormous gravitational field, plays an important protective role. By deflecting comets and asteroids that might otherwise hit Earth, Jupiter has helped to create a more stable environment for life to evolve here. It regulate other planets path.

@Cloud Computing
Icy Bands of helium/ nitrogen and Hydrogen liquid and metal acts like quantum gates. Thunder storms are the wiring in that icy hydrogen columns.  

Demystifying spinning storm QGates â€” Nand gates formed in zone and band belts ,which are moving in opposite direction to each other.

@Quantum Entanglement: NASA's JUNO probe provided Abstract painting like swirling clouds are graphical representation of quantum gates, It may be forming millions of Qubits and quantum entanglement.by lightning.

@79 Moon Keyboard:
Jupiter magnetic field is modulated by it's 79 moons circling around.
Like holes in the flute it regulates the power of Jupiter's magnetic message affecting the other planets.

Inner Core: Superconducting metallic center ,stores millions of years qubit data as a hard drive.
Note: Modern quantum computers use liquid helium and nitrogen in it.

@Every planet has his purpose:
Jupiter- is the King of planets If Sun is the heart for solar system, Jupiter is the Brain. The other planets are children of this kingdom.

Self organizing solar systems
The similar pattern can be found in other worlds with slight variations, with teenage Jupiter in them.

@Genetic algorithm of Quptiter.
Light and dark bands Jupiter acts as genetic algorithm for inner planets evolution. It generates mush ball of ice with ammonia core. This stores the temp memory to transfer to perm memory-the metallic core wardrive.

A new framework to view the world:
As a the world's brain, (it ha brain like folded exterior ) Jupiter has map of other planets connecting by quantum entanglement . Other tech used to connect are by quantum tunneling and teleportation.

@Red spot of Jupiter is the out put quantum chip.

Indian astrology consider Jupiter as the master of planets-called Guru-Master planet.

 Decades ago a star was found with diamond core naturally formed.
It is possible planets can form quantum machines.

@Jupiter Raising:
From Galileo to older civilizations got insights watching Jupiter .
In that sense, Jupiter wisdom matrix guiding for generations invisibly.
Replicating Jupiter layers can give a better quantum computer.
